If you're looking to start a GraphQL project using Node.js, I would recommend using Hasura, PostGraphile, or writing your own GraphQL schema + resolvers.

Which one you choose is going to come down to how you want to structure your project and personal preference.

If your a total noob that wants to learn backend development/GraphQL, start with ["Build your Own"](#build-your-own) then come back and try Hasura/PostGraphile to appreciate/better understand what they automate.

## Hasura and PostGraphile

Both take a PostgreSQL database as input and generate a GraphQL API on top of it. Instantly creating a GraphQL interface that allows you to do CRUD operations on all your database tables. This can save a ton of time and also solve things like the [N+1 problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCbFMZYQbxE) for you.

While you can get up and running very quickly with this approach, the more business logic you need to add across resolvers the less useful auto-generated CRUD becomes.

I would recommend as an exercise to try out both frameworks and add some custom business logic to a query or mutation to see how it works for each.

For example try adding validation + checking permissions:

```js
editNote = (id, newNote) => {
  if (newNote.title.includes("corona")) {
    throw new Error("no controversial topics")
  }

  if (!canEditNote(id)) {
    throw new Error("not authorized")
  }

  return dbUpdateNote(id, newNote)
}
```

Doing that will give you a good feel for which one you like better.

If you need more flexibility or you don't think you'll be benefiting from what Hasura/PostGraphile offers or you don't want to use PostgreSQL (that's the only database they support) then do the next approach.

## Build your Own

This consists of picking a server, a tool to create a GraphQL schema, and any number of data sources/databases. You'll have the most flexibility with this approach, but will have to write your own schema/resolvers.

An example stack:

- apollo-server-express (server)
- type-graphql (creates a GraphQL schema)
- typeorm (database ORM for PostgreSQL)

Note: you can also combine this API with the API generated by Hasura/PostGraphile.

Now let's get into some of the options for each piece of the stack.

### Pick a Server

- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) is the most popular and feature rich
- [fastify-gql](https://github.com/mcollina/fastify-gql) is the fastest
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is there if you like Angular

If your new and not sure which one to go with, I would start with `Apollo Server`.

Note: you can use any server with GraphQL, you mainly just need some kind of adapter that understands how to handle GraphQL requests.

Personally, I'm experimenting with a middleware which sits on top of `express`: https://github.com/benawad/express-gql.

### Pick a Tool for Creating a GraphQL Schema

If your using JavaScript go with this approach where you write a string to define the types:

```js
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Book {
    title: String
    author: String
  }
  type Query {
    books: [Book]
  }
`

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => [
      {
        title: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets",
        author: "J.K. Rowling",
      },
      {
        title: "Jurassic Park",
        author: "Michael Crichton",
      },
    ],
  },
}

const executableSchema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
})
```

This is built in with Apollo Server or you can use it with https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools.

If your using TypeScript go with [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) or [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/).

In general, I would go with GraphQL Nexus because it has better type inference (aka you don't have to explicitly write as many types and gives you more autocompletion), but there is 2 reasons I still think TypeGraphQL can be a good choice:

1. You like the decorator syntax better

```ts
import { ObjectType, Field } from "type-graphql"

@ObjectType()
export class Book {
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: true })
  title: string
  @Field(() => String, { nullable: true })
  author: string
}
```

Compared to GraphQL Nexus' syntax:

```ts
import { objectType, scalarType } from "nexus"

const Book = objectType({
  name: "Book",
  definition(t) {
    t.string("title", { nullable: true })
    t.string("author", { nullable: true })
  },
})
```

2. You're using [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)

It integrates nicely with TypeGraphQL, so you can use a single class for both your database and GraphQL types:

```ts
@ObjectType()
@Entity()
export class Movie extends BaseEntity {
  @Field(() => Int)
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number

  @Field()
  @Column()
  title: string

  @Field(() => Int)
  @Column("int", { default: 60 })
  minutes: number
}
```

Here's an introduction to this technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhzIjYQmWvs

### Pick a Database

Doesn't matter what you choose here, all of them can be used with GraphQL.

Personally, I like to use PostgreSQL with TypeORM, but you could go with MongoDB, MySQL, DynamoDB, Redis, etc...

PS: Prisma 2 is pretty good, but still in beta: https://www.isprisma2ready.com/

## Less Good Options

Nothing wrong with using one of the following, but for one reason or another I find them less optimal.

### AWS AppSync

Great for instantly creating an entire backend for simple examples, but difficult to figure out how to do more complex operations and dealing with AWS services can be a pain.

Looks interesting for offline apps though.

### Graph Databases that have GraphQL extensions

Including Neo4j, Dgraph, and ArangoDB just to name a few.

I wouldn't pick one of these databases because I wanted to use GraphQL.

If my project would benefit from a graph database then it's a nice plus that they integrate with GraphQL.

## Conclusion

Try Hasura/PostGraphile and if you don't like it, build your own GraphQL stack.

Currently, I'm using the following stack for http://mysaffronapp.com/ and would be happy to build another project with it.
